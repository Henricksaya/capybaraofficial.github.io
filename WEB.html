          <p><strong> A Problem in Need of a Creative Solution</strong><br>

           In the 1870s, newspapers and printers faced a very specific and very costly problem. Photography was a new and exciting medium at the time.
           Readers wanted to see more pictures, but nobody could figure out how to print images quickly and cheaply.</p>

            For example, if a newspaper wanted to print an image in the 1870s, 
            they had to commission an engraver to etch a copy of the photograph onto a steel plate by hand.
            These plates were used to press the image onto the page, but they often broke after just a few uses.
            This process of photoengraving, you can imagine, was remarkably time consuming and expensive.</p>
